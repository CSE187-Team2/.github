# Planned Tasks for Project 3

Hey Team!

This is my proposed plan on what tasks and issues I plan address for the rest of Project 3.
I made this plan based on where I believe I can be most helpful in our project. This schedule
is subject to change based on the issues I will be working on according to the Scrum/Kanban board.

Please feel more than free to let me know (or even change this README) if you all
prefer me to work on other tasks/issues.

## Thursday

* Refactor Shopping Cart Microservice using the feedback given by Professor Harrison during his Wednesday office hours. 
* Successfully implement the back-end mocks for the listing of a given user's shopping cart.
* Create Workflow for both Shopping Cart and Categories Microservices. This same workflow can be used across all our microservices.

## Friday
