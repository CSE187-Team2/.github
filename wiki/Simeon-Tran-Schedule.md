# Planned Tasks for Project 3

Hey Team!

This is my proposed plan on what tasks and issues I plan address for the rest of Project 3.
I made this plan based on where I believe I can be most helpful in our project.

The schedule below is my future plan for the rest of the project and is subject to change.
The issues I am currently working on are labelled in our Scrum/Kanbam board. This README is a way
for me to have a plan out what I will need to do in the future, and for you all to know what my plan is
(so you all can give me helpful feedback and advice). 

Please feel more than free to let me know (or even change this README) if you all
prefer me to work on other tasks/issues.

* Simeon

## Thursday

* Refactor Shopping Cart Microservice using the feedback given by Professor Harrison during his Wednesday office hours. 
* Successfully implement the back-end mocks for the listing of a given user's shopping cart.
* Create Workflow for both Shopping Cart and Categories Microservices. This same workflow can be used across all our microservices.

## Friday

* Implement a front-end webpage that allows each pre-defined user to see their shopping cart.

## Saturday

* Work with Russell to move the Sidebar created in "/search" to be used in the home page, as we all agreed that the functionality of "/search" shoulb be moved to the home page.
* Pick a task that is not already assigned that will move us closer to accomplish one "issue" in the "Project 3 MVP" column of our Scrum board. Once I have picked a task, then I will write up my schedule for Sunday to Thursday night (the Project 3 deadline).
