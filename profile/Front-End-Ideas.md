## Notes for Team

Hey Team! I wrote down some starting notes on what the front-end user experience should look like.
Feel free to make as many changes as you want in this page.

Is it possible if we can have a meeting to edit this page until we are all in agreement
on what we want the front-end user experience to be like? Doing so will give us the ability
to create a complete web app with all the features we have so far.

One (or a couple) of us could do a task to make sure that
our front-end works as described in this wiki page, while the rest
of us can work on the microservices, admin page, and new features for Project 3. Russell and I are willing
to take on this task/issue, so you all can work on the new features for Project 3.

We're doing great on our project! We just got to assemble our well-tested front-end components
and we'll have something awesome that users can use! 

Go Team!
